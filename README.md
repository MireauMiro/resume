# resume
This is an html/css template for setting up a resume website

Feel free to use for your own resume.

Ideally you want your name and job title to go 100% width of the space in the template, 
you will need to adjust the font sizes for those elements (in a few places to keep responsive).

For mine I put in a photo and adjusted the colors used in the CSS to match the image.
Consider substituting the background pattern for more customization.

After any customizations make sure to check your font/background colors for acceptable levels of contrast.

Using the "print" function of your browser should also produce a relatively solid PDF that can be used for job applications.

Other than that you should be able to copy/paste in your own info!
